6c89b8d - Daniel Callero, 2025-03-26 10:52:05 : Added processInvalidateBids
* Implemented invalidate command logic. Specification is missing, as well as some kind of optimization.

* fixed Award print structure to adhere to requirements

131240b - Daniel Callero, 2025-03-26 10:39:49 : Added processRemove
Implemented process Remove command logic. It could use a minor tweak in design, and specification is pending.

7864315 - Daniel Callero, 2025-03-26 10:15:56 : Added processStats
Revised from P1, incorporating compatibility with the new bid stack. This function is provisional and desperately needs optimization and readability improvements.

d260415 - Daniel Callero, 2025-03-26 09:46:50 : Added processAward
Implemented award command logic. Additionally, I separated the deletion logic from processDelete to facilitate its reuse in this operation.

400745b - Daniel Callero, 2025-03-26 09:08:12 : Added processBid
Revised from P1, incorporating compatibility with the new bid stack. This function is provisional and desperately needs optimization and readability improvements.

242a352 - Daniel Callero, 2025-03-25 22:56:44 : Added processDelete
Revised from P1, incorporating compatibility with the new bid stack. Now item is handled trough direct memory management to be able to clear bid stack from the code; due to that, printing now has to occur before deletion to ensure we don't try to access freed memory (item is no longer a local copy). Aside from those lines, this function is virtually the same.
